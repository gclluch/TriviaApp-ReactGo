## CapTrivia Multiplayer Game Plan

### Part 1: Refactor and Enhance Codebase

#### Backend (Go)

- **Organize Into Packages**
  - `models` for data structures (`Question`, `PlayerSession`).
  - `handlers` for HTTP handlers (`StartGameHandler`, `QuestionsHandler`).
  - `services` for business logic.
  - `store` for database interactions.
  - `config` for configuration settings.

- **Database Integration**
  - Transition from in-memory to PostgreSQL database.
  - Create necessary tables and integrate with the backend.

#### Frontend (React)

- **Componentize UI**
  - Break down `App.js` into smaller components for readability and reuse.

- **State Management**
  - Use Context API or Redux for managing complex state.

- **Styling and Responsiveness**
  - Ensure UI responsiveness and consider using a CSS framework.

### Part 2: Implement Multiplayer Functionality

#### Backend Enhancements

- **WebSocket Integration**
  - Use WebSockets for real-time communication between players and server.

- **Multiplayer Game Sessions**
  - Support for multiple players per session, including unique game links and synchronization.

- **Gameplay Logic**
  - Implement logic for countdowns, question answering, and scoring.

#### Frontend Enhancements

- **Real-Time Communication**
  - Implement WebSockets on the frontend for real-time updates.

- **Multiplayer UI Components**
  - Lobby/Waiting Room, Countdown Timer, Real-Time Answer Submission, Scoreboard.

- **Navigation and Routing**
  - Use React Router for managing different views.

### Technical Considerations

- **Testing**
  - Implement unit tests for both backend (Go) and frontend
