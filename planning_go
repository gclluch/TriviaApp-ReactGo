## Go Backend Refactoring Plan

### Code Organization

- **Separate Concerns into Packages**
  - `handlers` for HTTP handlers.
  - `models` for data structures like `Question`.
  - `services` for business logic, such as session management and scoring.
  - `store` for database interactions.
  - `config` for configuration settings.

### Improve Session Management

- **Database Persistence**
  - Persist sessions in a database to support scalability and prevent data loss.

### Use a Database for Questions

- **Database Management of Questions**
  - Store questions in a database for dynamic updates and easier management.

### Remove Global State

- **Safe Random Number Generation**
  - Use local instances of the random generator or seed once to ensure thread safety.

### Concurrency

- **Idiomatic Go Concurrency**
  - Utilize channels or `sync.Map` for more efficient concurrency control.

### Error Handling

- **Custom Error Types**
  - Create and handle custom errors to provide clear client feedback.

### Testing

- **Unit Testing**
  - Develop unit tests for handlers and business logic to ensure reliability.

### Security

- **Secure Session IDs**
  - Generate secure, unpredictable session IDs to enhance security.

### Dependency Injection

- **Decouple Code**
  - Use constructor functions to pass dependencies like session stores to handlers.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Structured Logging**
  - Implement structured logging for requests and errors to facilitate monitoring.

### Configuration

- **External Configuration**
  - Utilize configuration files or environment variables for flexible settings.

### Graceful Shutdown

- **Safe Server Termination**
  - Implement graceful shutdown logic to handle server stops smoothly.

### Update Libraries

- **Modernize Codebase**
  - Replace `ioutil.ReadFile` with `os.ReadFile` following Go 1.16 updates.

Code Organization and Best Practices
Separate Concerns:

Split the code into multiple files or packages. For example, handlers can be in their own package, and game logic can be in another.
Consider creating separate files for your types (Question, PlayerSession, SessionStore).
Session IDs:

Instead of using rand.Read directly, use crypto/rand for more cryptographically secure random bytes.
Error Handling:

Provide more informative error messages and log them where necessary.
Return appropriate HTTP status codes that reflect the error situation more accurately.
Configuration:

Use a configuration file or environment variables for settings such as the location of questions.json, and perhaps even the number of questions to return, etc.
Concurrency:

Since you're using a mutex to protect the session store, ensure you're not locking for longer than needed. It's good practice to keep the critical section as small as possible.
Middleware:

You are using CORS middleware; make sure you configure it properly for production to not allow all origins.
Logging:

Add more logging throughout the application for key events, such as session creation, question retrieval, and server startup.
Enhancements and Features
Real-time Updates:

Consider using WebSockets for real-time communication if you plan to extend this to a multiplayer game where real-time updates are necessary.
Persistence:

Use a database instead of an in-memory store to persist session data. This would allow your game server to restart without losing all the current game sessions.
Testing:

Write tests for your endpoints and logic. The standard library's testing package should suffice for this scale of the application.
Refactoring:

Refactor the loadQuestions to not use ioutil.ReadFile, which is deprecated since Go 1.16. Use os.ReadFile instead.
Dependency Management:

If not already done, use Go modules for dependency management.
Graceful Shutdown:

Implement graceful shutdown to handle SIGTERM and SIGINT signals, allowing your server to terminate gracefully.
Question Shuffle:

You could move the rand.Seed call to main or an init function so it's not re-seeded every time shuffleQuestions is called, which is not efficient.
Code Comments and Documentation:

Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and package. This is especially helpful for other developers who may work on your code in the future.
Secure Headers:

Implement security headers for HTTP responses.
