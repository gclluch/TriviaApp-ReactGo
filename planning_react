## React Frontend Refactoring Plan

### Componentization and Structure (DONE)

- **Break Down into Components** (DONE)
  - Split `App.js` into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability.
    - `StartGameButton` for initiating a new game.
    - `QuestionDisplay` for showing current question and options.
    - `ScoreDisplay` for showing the player's score.
    - `LoadingIndicator` for displaying a loading state.
    - `ErrorMessage` for showing error messages.

- **Use of Component Props** (DONE)
  - Pass necessary data to child components through props to maintain a unidirectional data flow.

### State Management (DONE)

- **Local vs. Global State** (DONE)
  - Evaluate if any state can be lifted up or needs to be shared across components. If so, consider using Context API or Redux for global state management.

- **Custom Hooks**
  - Create custom hooks for fetching data from the backend to encapsulate and reuse logic.

### Styling and Layout

- **CSS Modules or Styled Components**
  - Use CSS Modules or styled-components for component-scoped styling to avoid styling conflicts and enhance maintainability.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Ensure the UI is responsive and provides a good user experience across different device sizes.

### Performance Optimization (DONE - onSubmit change)

- **React.memo and useCallback** (NOT NECESSARY)
  - Utilize `React.memo` for memoizing components and `useCallback` to memoize callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Lazy Loading**
  - Implement lazy loading for components that are not immediately needed using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

### Error Handling and User Feedback

- **Graceful Error Handling**
  - Implement robust error handling in the UI to catch and display error states gracefully.

- **User Feedback**
  - Provide immediate feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success/error messages).

### Accessibility (ARIAS ADDED)

- **Accessibility (a11y) Enhancements**
  - Ensure that the application is accessible by following best practices, such as semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes.

### Testing

- **Unit and Integration Tests**
  - Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for component interactions using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

### Documentation and Comments

- **Component Documentation**
  - Document each component's props and intended use cases for better collaboration and future reference.

- **Code Comments**
  - Add meaningful comments to complex logic to enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Version Control and Deployment

- **Branching Strategy**
  - Adopt a consistent branching strategy for features, fixes, and releases to manage codebase changes effectively.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
